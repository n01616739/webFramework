# Secure DB-Driven Node/Express App

## Objective

The objective of this project is to explore and apply concepts learned in the course by developing a secure, database-driven Node/Express app, specifically focusing on building a REST API that interacts with a database.

## Description

In this project, we will be utilizing Node.js and Express to build a secure web application that connects to a database for storing and retrieving data. The app will include RESTful API endpoints that allow for standard CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). Security best practices will be followed to ensure that the application is protected against common vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection and unauthorized access.

### Key Features:
- **REST API**: 
- **Database-Driven**: The application will interact with a relational database (Mongo) to store and retrieve data.
- **Security**: Implementing security measures such as:
  - Input validation and sanitization to prevent SQL injection.
  - User authentication and authorization .
  - Password hashing ().
  - Secure HTTP (using  CORS).
